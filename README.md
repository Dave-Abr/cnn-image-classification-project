# 🌍 CNN Image Classification - Natural Scenes

This project demonstrates the training of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify natural scene images into one of six categories. The model is trained on a dataset of real-world images representing various environments across the globe.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of colored images representing six different natural scenes:

- **🏙️ buildings**: Scenes with buildings or urban architecture.
- **🌲 forest**: Green forest or woodland environments.
- **❄️ glacier**: Ice and snow-covered glacial landscapes.
- **⛰️ mountain**: Natural mountainous scenes.
- **🌊 sea**: Coastal or open sea environments.
- **🚧 street**: City streets and urban settings.

Each image is labeled accordingly and has been preprocessed and stored in serialized NumPy `.npy` format for efficient loading.

## 🧠 Project Goals
Load and preprocess image data stored in .npy files.

Build and train a CNN model using Keras or PyTorch.

Evaluate model performance on image classification.

Visualize training progress and sample predictions.
